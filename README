NYC Vehicle Collisions Dashboard
An interactive data visualization dashboard analyzing NYC vehicle collision patterns, injury risks, and contributing factors using Python, Dash, and Plotly.
Project Overview
This project provides comprehensive insights into New York City traffic collisions through interactive visualizations. The dashboard enables users to explore crash patterns across boroughs, time periods, vehicle types, and demographic factors to identify high-risk scenarios and inform traffic safety strategies.
Features

Interactive Filtering: Filter data by borough, year, vehicle category, contributing factors, and injury types
Natural Language Search: Search using free text (e.g., "Manhattan 2022 pedestrian crashes")
9 Comprehensive Visualizations:

Yearly injury trends across boroughs
Top contributing factors analysis
Borough-level injury distribution
Day-of-week crash patterns
Vehicle category severity analysis
Gender-based crash involvement
Hourly injury risk by road user type
Vehicle-hour severity heatmap
Age group vulnerability analysis

Research questions and visualizations 
----------------------------------------
Nouran Ashraf:
Visualization #1 :
Research Question 1: “At which hours do pedestrians/cyclists/motorists face highest injury risk?” → LINE CHART
Visualization #2 :
Research Question 2: “How does crash severity vary by vehicle category & hour?” → HEATMAP

Nour:
Visualization #1 :
Research Question 1: What is the relationship between street type/location and crash severity?
Visualized through horizontal bar chart.

Visualization #2 :
Research Question 2: Which age groups are most vulnerable to severe injuries, and does this differ by person type (pedestrian, cyclist,motorist)?
Visualized through vertical bar chart.

nouran mohamed:
Research Question 1 (answered by the bar graph):
Which boroughs experience the highest number of injuries for a selected person type
(pedestrian, cyclist, or motorist) based on the search criteria?

Research Question 2 (answered by the line graph):
How are crashes distributed across days of the week for the selected subset
of crashes (filtered by borough, year, person type, or vehicle)?

 rika:
 Visualization #1 :
Research question: how do injuries change across years and boroughs?
Visualized throughl line chart .

 Visualization #2:
Research question: which contributing factor vechile cause the most crashes?
Visualized through bar chart.


Mariam Ayman:
How do different vehicle types contribute to injury severity in NYC?
How does crash frequency differ between males and females across NYC boroughs?
