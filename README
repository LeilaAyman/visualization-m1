Overall Process

Our team divided the project into four major phases to ensure a clean data pipeline and a smooth visualization development process:

1)EDA phase
2)Pre-Cleaning Phase
3) Data Integration (Join) & Post-Cleaning
4)Dashboard Development & Deployment

_Our work flow from EDA till webpage development:

We collaborated using a shared Google Colab notebook for all preprocessing and exploratory work, and later moved to VS Code + Dash to build the interactive dashboard.
The final website was deployed through Render, with the dataset hosted on Google Drive due to its large size.

1) Exploratory Data Analysis (Handled by Marina and Nour):

Marina and Nour conducted the EDA required to understand the dataset structure and identify meaningful insights.
She visualized:

Distributions

Outliers

Correlations

Temporal patterns

Injury trends

The EDA guided the selection of the 10 final research questions and visualization types.


 2) Pre-Cleaning (Handled by Marina and Nour):

Marina and Nour were responsible for the initial raw dataset cleaning, which included:

Removing obvious inconsistencies and corrupted rows

Handling null values in critical columns

Normalizing text fields (uppercasing, trimming whitespace, etc.)

Converting date and time fields to proper formats

Extracting year and hour attributes

This stage ensured that the dataset was usable for deeper processing.

3) Joining & Post-Cleaning(Handled by Mariam, Nouran Mohamed & Nouran Ashraf)
_Join (Merge):

 Integration of the crashes and persons datasets, ensuring:

Correct key matching ( Collision_ID)

Maintaining referential integrity

Avoiding duplicate join rows

Validating merged statistics

_Post-Cleaning Tasks:

Fixing data types (numeric, categorical, datetime)

Creating derived fields such as:

total_injuries

severity score

vehicle category

age groups

Removing duplicates

Standardizing column names across datasets
This created the final unified cleaned dataset used for all visualizations.


4) Dashboard Development & Deployment:

We collaboratively built the web dashboard using:

Python Dash (for layout, callbacks, and interactive visuals)

Plotly Express (for charts)

VS Code (for code organization)

We then:

Uploaded the dataset to Google Drive because it exceeds GitHub’s file size limit

Hosted the dashboard on Render

Connected the live dataset URL to the final application

 TEAM VISUALIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES (By Research Question)
Nouran Ashraf:

Q1: At which hours do pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists face the highest injury risk?
→ Line Chart (Hourly Injury Risk)

Q2: How does crash severity vary by vehicle category and hour?
→ Heatmap (Vehicle Category × Hour Severity)

Nouran Mohamed:

Q1: Which boroughs experience the highest injuries for a selected person type (pedestrian / cyclist / motorist)?
→ Bar Chart (Borough Injuries)

Q2: How are crashes distributed across the days of the week for the selected filters?
→ Line Chart (Crash Frequency by Weekday)

Rika:

Q1: How do injuries change across years and boroughs?
→ Line Chart (Injuries Over Time)

Q2: Which contributing factors cause the most crashes?
→ Horizontal Bar Chart (Top Contributing Factors)

Mariam

Q1: How do different vehicle types contribute to injury severity in NYC?
→ Bar Chart (Severity by Vehicle Type)

Q2: How does crash frequency differ between males and females across NYC boroughs?
→ Grouped Bar Chart (Gender × Borough)

Nour:
Visualization #1 :
Research Question 1: What is the relationship between street type/location and crash severity?
Visualized through vertical bar chart - street name by severity  ( severity being a custom attribute which is the sum of all injuries and killed count )

Visualization #2 :
Research Question 2: Which age groups are most vulnerable to severe injuries, and does this differ by person type (pedestrian, cyclist,motorist)?
Visualized through vertical bar chart - person age by count
